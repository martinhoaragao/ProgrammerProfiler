"Optimization","UseArrayListInsteadOfVector","ArrayList is a much better Collection implementation than Vector if thread-safe operation is not required","3"
"Optimization","SimplifyStartsWith","Since it passes in a literal of length 1, calls to (string).startsWith can be rewritten using (string).charAt(0) at the expense of some readability","3"
"Optimization","UseStringBufferForStringAppends","The use of the '+=' operator for appending strings causes the JVM to create and use an internal StringBuffer.If a non-trivial number of these concatenations are being used then the explicit use of a StringBuilder or threadsafe StringBuffer is recommended to avoid this.","3"
"Optimization","UseArraysAsList","The java.util.Arrays class has a 'asList' method that should be used when you want to create a new List froman array of objects. It is faster than executing a loop to copy all the elements of the array one by one.","3"
"Optimization","AvoidArrayLoops","Instead of manually copying data between two arrays, use the efficient System.arraycopy method instead.","3"
"Optimization","UnnecessaryWrapperObjectCreation","Most wrapper classes provide static conversion methods that avoid the need to create intermediate objectsjust to create the primitive forms. Using these avoids the cost of creating objects that also need to be garbage-collected later.","3"
"Optimization","AddEmptyString","The conversion of literals to strings by concatenating them with empty strings is inefficient.It is much better to use one of the type-specific toString() methods instead.","3"
"Optimization","RedundantFieldInitializer","Java will initialize fields with known default values so any explicit initialization of those same defaultsis redundant and results in a larger class file (approximately three additional bytecode instructions per field).","3"
"Optimization","PrematureDeclaration","Checks for variables that are defined before they might be used. A reference is deemed to be premature if it is created right before a block of code that doesn't use it that also has the ability to return or throw an exception.","3"
"Basic","JumbledIncrementer","Avoid jumbled loop incrementers - its usually a mistake, and is confusing even if intentional.","3"
"Basic","ForLoopShouldBeWhileLoop","Some for loops can be simplified to while loops, this makes them more concise.","3"
"Basic","OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode","Override both public boolean Object.equals(Object other), and public int Object.hashCode(), or override neither. Even if you are inheriting a hashCode() from a parent class, consider implementing hashCode and explicitly delegating to your superclass.","3"
"Basic","DoubleCheckedLocking","Partially created objects can be returned by the Double Checked Locking pattern when used in Java.An optimizing JRE may assign a reference to the baz variable before it creates the object thereference is intended to point to.For more details refer to 'http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2001/jw-0209-double.html' or 'http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html'","1"

"Basic","ClassCastExceptionWithToArray","When deriving an array of a specific class from your Collection, one should provide an array ofthe same class as the parameter of the toArray() method. Doing otherwise you will will resultin a ClassCastException.","3"
"Basic","AvoidDecimalLiteralsInBigDecimalConstructor","One might assume that the result of 'new BigDecimal(0.1)'' is exactly equal to 0.1, but it is actuallyequal to .1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a double (or as a binary fraction of any finitelength). Thus, the long value that is being passed in to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1,appearances notwithstanding.The (String) constructor, on the other hand, is perfectly predictable 'new BigDecimal('0.1')' is exactly equal to 0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally recommended that the(String) constructor be used in preference to this one.","3"
"Basic","MisplacedNullCheck","The null check here is misplaced. If the variable is null a NullPointerException will be thrown.Either the check is useless (the variable will never be 'null') or it is incorrect.","3"
"Basic","AvoidThreadGroup","Avoid using java.lang.ThreadGroup; although it is intended to be used in a threaded environmentit contains methods that are not thread-safe.","3"
"Basic","BrokenNullCheck","The null check is broken since it will throw a NullPointerException itself.It is likely that you used || instead of && or vice versa.","2"

"Design","UseUtilityClass","For classes that only have static methods, consider making them utility classes.Note that this doesn't apply to abstract classes, since their subclasses maywell include non-static methods. Also, if you want this class to be a utility class,remember to add a private constructor to prevent instantiation.(Note, that this use was known before PMD 5.1.0 as UseSingleton).","3"

"Design","AvoidReassigningParameters","Reassigning values to incoming parameters is not recommended. Use temporary local variables instead.","2"
"Design","SwitchDensity","A high ratio of statements to labels in a switch statement implies that the switch statement is overloaded. Consider moving the statements into new methods or creating subclasses based on the switch variable.","3"
"Design","ConstructorCallsOverridableMethod","Calling overridable methods during construction poses a risk of invoking methods on an incompletely constructed object and can be difficult to debug.It may leave the sub-class unable to construct its superclass or forced to replicate the construction process completely within itself, losing the ability to call super(). If the default constructor contains a call to an overridable method, the subclass may be completely uninstantiable. Note that this includes method calls throughout the control flow graph - i.e., if a constructor Foo() calls a private method bar() that calls a public method buz(), this denotes a problem.","1"
"Design","AccessorClassGeneration","Instantiation by way of private constructors from outside of the constructor's class often causes the generation of an accessor. A factory method, or non-privatization of the constructor can eliminate this situation. The generated class file is actually an interface. It gives the accessing class the ability to invoke a new hidden package scope constructor that takes the interface as a supplementary parameter. This turns a private constructor effectively into one with package scope, and is challenging to discern.","3"
"Design","FinalFieldCouldBeStatic","If a final field is assigned to a compile-time constant, it could be made static, thus saving overhead in each object at runtime.","3"
"Design","CloseResource","Ensure that resources (like Connection, Statement, and ResultSet objects) are always closed after use.","3"
"Design","NonStaticInitializer","A non-static initializer block will be called any time a constructor is invoked (just prior to invoking the constructor). While this is a valid language construct, it is rarely used and is confusing.","3"
"Design","DefaultLabelNotLastInSwitchStmt","By convention, the default label should be the last label in a switch statement.","3"
"Design","NonCaseLabelInSwitchStatement","A non-case label (e.g. a named break/continue label) was present in a switch statement.This legal, but confusing. It is easy to mix up the case labels and the non-case labels.","3"
"Design","OptimizableToArrayCall","Calls to a collection's toArray() method should specify target arrays sized to match the size of thecollection. Initial arrays that are too small are discarded in favour of new ones that have to be createdthat are the proper size.","3"
"Design","BadComparison","Avoid equality comparisons with Double.NaN. Due to the implicit lack of representationprecision when comparing floating point numbers these are likely to cause logic errors.","3"
"Design","EqualsNull","Tests for null should not use the equals() method. The '==' operator should be used instead.","1"
"Design","ConfusingTernary","Avoid negation within an 'if' expression with an 'else' clause. For example, rephrase: if (x != y) diff(); else same();as: if (x == y) same(); else diff();Most 'if (x != y)'' cases without an 'else' are often return cases, so consistent use of this rule makes the code easier to read. Also, this resolves trivial ordering problems, suchas 'does the error case go first?'' or 'does the common case go first?'.","3"
"Design","InstantiationToGetClass","Avoid instantiating an object just to call getClass() on it; use the .class public member instead.","4"

"Design","SimpleDateFormatNeedsLocale","Be sure to specify a Locale when creating SimpleDateFormat instances to ensure that locale-appropriateformatting is used.","3"
"Design","ImmutableField","Identifies private fields whose values never change once they are initialized either in the declaration of the field or by a constructor. This helps in converting existing classes to becoming immutable ones.","3"

"Design","MissingStaticMethodInNonInstantiatableClass","A class that has private constructors and does not have any static methods or fields cannot be used.","3"
"Design","AvoidSynchronizedAtMethodLevel","Method-level synchronization can cause problems when new code is added to the method. Block-level synchronization helps to ensure that only the code that needs synchronization gets it.","3"
"Design","MissingBreakInSwitch","Switch statements without break or return statements for each case optionmay indicate problematic behaviour. Empty cases are ignored as these indicate an intentional fall-through.","3"
"Design","UseNotifyAllInsteadOfNotify","Thread.notify() awakens a thread monitoring the object. If more than one thread is monitoring, then onlyone is chosen. The thread chosen is arbitrary; thus its usually safer to call notifyAll() instead.","3"
"Design","AvoidInstanceofChecksInCatchClause","Each caught exception type should be handled in its own catch clause.","3"
"Design","AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod","The abstract class does not contain any abstract methods. An abstract class suggestsan incomplete implementation, which is to be completed by subclasses implementing theabstract methods. If the class is intended to be used as a base class only (not to be instantiateddirectly) a protected constructor can be provided prevent direct instantiation.","3"
"Design","SimplifyConditional","No need to check for null before an instanceof; the instanceof keyword returns false when given a null argument.","3"
"Design","CompareObjectsWithEquals","Use equals() to compare object references; avoid comparing them with ==.","3"

"Design","UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn","Avoid the creation of unnecessary local variables","3"
"Design","NonThreadSafeSingleton","Non-thread safe singletons can result in bad state changes. Eliminatestatic singletons if possible by instantiating the object directly. Staticsingletons are usually not needed as only a single instance exists anyway.Other possible fixes are to synchronize the entire method or to use aninitialize-on-demand holder class (do not use the double-check idiom).See Effective Java, item 48.","3"
"Design","SingleMethodSingleton","Some classes contain overloaded getInstance. The problem with overloaded getInstance methodsis that the instance created using the overloaded method is not cached and so, for each call and new objects will be created for every invocation.","2"
"Design","SingletonClassReturningNewInstance","Some classes contain overloaded getInstance. The problem with overloaded getInstance methodsis that the instance created using the overloaded method is not cached and so, for each call and new objects will be created for every invocation.","2"
"Design","UncommentedEmptyMethodBody","Uncommented Empty Method Body finds instances where a method body does not containstatements, but there is no comment. By explicitly commenting empty method bodiesit is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentionalempty methods.","3"
"Design","UncommentedEmptyConstructor","Uncommented Empty Constructor finds instances where a constructor does notcontain statements, but there is no comment. By explicitly commenting emptyconstructors it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented)and unintentional empty constructors.","3"
"Design","AvoidConstantsInterface","An interface should be used only to characterize the external behaviour of an implementing class using an interface as a container of constants is a poor usage pattern and not recommended.","3"
"Design","UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter","SimpleDateFormat instances are not synchronized. Sun recommends using separate format instancesfor each thread. If multiple threads must access a static formatter, the formatter must be synchronized either on method or block level.","3"
"Design","PreserveStackTrace","Throwing a new exception from a catch block without passing the original exception into thenew exception will cause the original stack trace to be lost making it difficult to debug effectively.","3"
"Design","UseCollectionIsEmpty","The isEmpty() method on java.util.Collection is provided to determine if a collection has any elements.Comparing the value of size() to 0 does not convey intent as well as the isEmpty() method.","3"
"Design","ClassWithOnlyPrivateConstructorsShouldBeFinal","A class with only private constructors should be final, unless the private constructor is invoked by a inner class.","1"
"Design","EmptyMethodInAbstractClassShouldBeAbstract","Empty methods in an abstract class should be tagged as abstract. This helps to remove their inapproprate usage by developers who should be implementing their own versions in the concrete subclasses.","1"
"Design","SingularField","Fields whose scopes are limited to just single methods do not rely on the containingobject to provide them to other methods. They may be better implemented as local variableswithin those methods.","3"
"Design","ReturnEmptyArrayRatherThanNull","For any method that returns an array, it is a better to return an empty array rather than a null reference. This removes the need for null checking all results and avoids inadvertentNullPointerExceptions.","1"
"Design","AbstractClassWithoutAnyMethod","If an abstract class does not provides any methods, it may be acting as a simple data container that is not meant to be instantiated. In this case, it is probably better to use a private or protected constructor in order to prevent instantiation than make the class misleadingly abstract.","1"
"Design","TooFewBranchesForASwitchStatement","Switch statements are indended to be used to support complex branching behaviour. Using a switch for only a few cases is ill-advised, since switches are not as easy to understand as if-then statements. In these cases use theif-then statement to increase code readability.","3"
"Design","LogicInversion","Use opposite operator instead of negating the whole expression with a logic complement operator.","3"
"Design","UseVarargs","Java 5 introduced the varargs parameter declaration for methods and constructors. This syntactic sugar provides flexibility for users of these methods and constructors, allowing them to avoid having to deal with the creation of an array.","4"

"Design","AvoidProtectedMethodInFinalClassNotExtending","Do not use protected methods in most final classes since they cannot be subclassed. This should only be allowed in final classes that extend other classes with protected methods (whosevisibility cannot be reduced). Clarify your intent by using private or package access modifiers instead.","3"
"Code Size","NPathComplexity","The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.A threshold of 200 is generally considered the point where measures should be taken to reduce complexity and increase readability.","3"
"Code Size","ExcessiveMethodLength","When methods are excessively long this usually indicates that the method is doing more than itsname/signature might suggest. They also become challenging for others to digest since excessive scrolling causes readers to lose focus.Try to reduce the method length by creating helper methods and removing any copy/pasted code.","3"
"Code Size","ExcessiveParameterList","Methods with numerous parameters are a challenge to maintain, especially if most of them share thesame datatype. These situations usually denote the need for new objects to wrap the numerous parameters.","3"
"Code Size","ExcessiveClassLength","Excessive class file lengths are usually indications that the class may be burdened with excessive responsibilities that could be provided by external classes or functions. In breaking these methodsapart the code becomes more managable and ripe for reuse.","3"
"Code Size","CyclomaticComplexity","Complexity directly affects maintenance costs is determined by the number of decision points in a method plus one for the method entry.

"Controversial","NullAssignment","Assigning a 'null' to a variable (outside of its declaration) is usually bad form. Sometimes, this typeof assignment is an indication that the programmer doesn't completely understand what is going on in the code.

"Controversial","AvoidFinalLocalVariable","Avoid using final local variables, turn them into fields.","3"
"Controversial","AvoidUsingShortType","Java uses the 'short' type to reduce memory usage, not to optimize calculation. In fact, the JVM does not have anyarithmetic capabilities for the short type: the JVM must convert the short into an int, do the proper calculationand convert the int back to a short. Thus any storage gains found through use of the 'short' type may be offset byadverse impacts on performance.","1"
"Controversial","AvoidUsingVolatile","Use of the keyword 'volatile' is generally used to fine tune a Java application, and therefore, requiresa good expertise of the Java Memory Model. Moreover, its range of action is somewhat misknown. Therefore,the volatile keyword should not be used for maintenance purpose and portability.","2"

"Controversial","AvoidLiteralsInIfCondition","Avoid using hard-coded literals in conditional statements. By declaring them as static variablesor private members with descriptive names maintainability is enhanced. By default, the literals '-1' and '0' are ignored.More exceptions can be defined with the property 'ignoreMagicNumbers'.","3"
"Controversial","UseObjectForClearerAPI","When you write a public method, you should be thinking in terms of an API. If your method is public, it means other classwill use it, therefore, you want (or need) to offer a comprehensive and evolutive API. If you pass a lot of informationas a simple series of Strings, you may think of using an Object to represent all those information. You'll get a simplierAPI (such as doWork(Workload workload), rather than a tedious series of Strings) and more importantly, if you need at somepoint to pass extra data, you'll be able to do so by simply modifying or extending Workload without any modification toyour API.","3"
